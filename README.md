# Crime Prediction with Machine Learning
## Author: Frank Serafine | README

Using publicly-available crime data from the FBI, this project aimed to train several machine learning models to be able to predict crime data.

The database constructed in SQLite from the FBI's provided CSV files can be downloaded [from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OygVhK2Ah8oR5DNsJxNR1V4C8CtN9Pb1/view?usp=sharing), and is approximately 1.5 GB in size.

The final CSV of 5,883,982 crime observations used to train the models, taken from a custom view within this database, can be downloaded [from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pJ4gI36O67LvdLTRKan774GaBXEcsFB/view?usp=sharing), and is approximately 700 MB.

Files that exist in this repo serve to highlight the work that went in to the project and detail the results.
