# Crime Prediction with Machine Learning
## Author: Frank Serafine | README

Using publicly-available crime data from the FBI, this project aimed to train several machine learning models to be able to predict crime data for a given year.

The database constructed in SQLite from the FBI's provided CSV files can be downloaded [from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q7emKSnD8K-WJrrnZW410LEhxlXoYg63/view?usp=sharing), and is approximately 600 MB zipped / 2.5 GB unzipped.

The final pre-processed CSV of 6,319,810 observations covering 3,400,357 individual crime offenses is narrowed down in the Jupyter Notebook file in this repo to 3,652 single-day aggregates used to train the models. It can be downloaded [from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pJ4gI36O67LvdLTRKan774GaBXEcsFB/view?usp=sharing), and is approximately 700 MB.

Files that exist in this repo serve to highlight the work that went in to the project and detail the results.
